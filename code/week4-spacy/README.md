# NLP with spaCy

To run these notebooks you first need Jupyter and ipynb, the latter is a way to import code from notebooks.

```bash
$> pip install ipykernel
$> pip install ipynb
```

You can also use Jupyter Labs, which gives you a bit more functionality:

```bash
$> pip install jupyterlab
$> pip install ipynb
```

And you need spaCy of course:

```bash
$> pip install spacy==3.0.3
$> python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
$> python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```
